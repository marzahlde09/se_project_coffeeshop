# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform
- iFrames

## Plan on improving the project

- Form info should be collected and used to make reservations that a host could see
- datetime-local could be a calendar with available times listed so that customers don't book a table when the coffee shop will already be full
- Menu could be interactive so that hovering over menu items displays nutrition info and descriptions
